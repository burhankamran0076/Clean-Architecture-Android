Introduction
This project is a demonstration of how to build a News API using Clean Architecture on the Android platform with Kotlin. The main goal is to showcase how to structure an Android application using the principles of Clean Architecture, making it easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

Features
Fetching news articles from a remote server using a News API
Displaying news articles in a user-friendly way on an Android application
Support for viewing news by different categories and sources
Caching mechanism to reduce network requests and improve performance
Error handling for network issues and data inconsistencies
Unit tests for business logic and use cases
Architecture
The project follows the Clean Architecture principles to achieve a clear separation of concerns and maintainability. The architecture is divided into three main layers:

Presentation Layer: This layer contains the Android UI components, including Activities, Fragments, and ViewModels. The ViewModels interact with the Domain layer to fetch data and provide it to the UI components.

Domain Layer: The Domain layer contains the business logic of the application. It defines entities, use cases, and interfaces for repositories, which act as contracts for data retrieval. The use cases orchestrate the data flow and business rules.

Data Layer: The Data layer is responsible for providing data to the Domain layer. It includes implementations of the repository interfaces defined in the Domain layer. The Data layer communicates with the remote server using APIs and handles data caching.

Setup
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/burhankamran0076/Clean-Architecture-Android/tree/master
Open the project in Android Studio.
Build the project to fetch dependencies.
Connect your Android device or emulator.
Run the application.
Usage
Upon running the application, you will be presented with a list of news articles from different sources and categories.

Dependencies
The project utilizes the following main dependencies:

Retrofit: For making network requests and handling API calls.
Room: For local data caching and persistence.
ViewModel: For handling UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware manner.
LiveData: For observing data changes and updating the UI.
Gson: For JSON parsing.
Coroutine: For managing background threads with simplified code.
Make sure to check the build.gradle files for a complete list of dependencies.
